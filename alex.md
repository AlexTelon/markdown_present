# General thoughts

If you dont write code/tests much at work then you will probably have less use for chatGPT. 

If you write a lot of code however..
And especially if you are working on something new!

# chatGPT and github copilot

I much prefer chatGPT when doing new development and when the domain is unknown to me.

I suspect it might be the other way around for a larger project in which you already know the language/framework well.


# chatGPT vs stackoverflow

Days when I have visited stackoverflow at least once has dropped since I started using chatGPT.

 - Lots of sick/VAB days jan-feb however. But the number of total visits must have dropped

 - I rather be without stackoverflow than chatGPT.

# My experience

My experience is limited to mostly small projects. And some limited small-medium projects at work. In all these cases it has been new development.

 - [taskgit](https://github.com/AlexTelon/taskgit) An in-file project manager tool.
 - [GetSymbol](https://github.com/AlexTelon/GetSymbol) cli tool using openai API's to get the unicode symbol you ask for.
 - [markdown_present](https://github.com/AlexTelon/markdown_present) markdown to presentation too.
 - [chatcli](https://github.com/AlexTelon/chatcli) cli tool that given a request in english gives a bash command.
 - [todo](https://github.com/AlexTelon/todo) A todo application with cli and web interface.

Mostly `python`, `html`, `css` and `javascript`. I only know `python` well. 

But I have also used it at work for developing a new android automotive development.

Many small one-of scripts and help with questions like how to route udp trafic on my windows host to the android automotive emulator.

I have **not** used it in a large existing codebase. So cannot say how useful or not it might be in that kind of environment.

# Generate toml

Great for quickly iterating on the exact format that should be used.

   * It knows adb commands

   * Temporary server that sends json for testing.
     * If you can generate some code in 10min then you can throw it away. If you had spent 3h then you want to save it somewhere? -->

# Using openAI api's

They are not free, but quite cheap.

Good documentation.
