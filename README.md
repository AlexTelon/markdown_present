# Presentation Tool
This is a small presentation tool written in Python and JavaScript that converts Markdown documents into HTML presentations that can be navigated using arrow keys or other controls.

## Usage
Install Python and the markdown library (if not already installed).

Write your presentation content in Markdown format and save it to a file named presentation.md.

Optionally, add images or other assets to the template directory.

Run the main.py script to convert the Markdown file to an HTML presentation:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Open the resulting presentation.html file in a web browser to view the presentation.

## Customization
You can customize the appearance and behavior of your presentation by modifying the style.css and script.js files. These files contain CSS and JavaScript code that controls the look and feel of the presentation, as well as the navigation behavior.
